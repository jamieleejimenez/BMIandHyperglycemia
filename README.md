# BMIandHyperglycemia

Diabetes and obesity are two of America's greatest health issues in the 21st century. Several studies have found that roughly 50% of the United States population is obese or morbidly obese and that around 13% of adults are diabetic. Scientists have examined the potential relationship between these two variables and have concluded that obesity can lead to diabetes if not treated. But, is it possible to predict hyperglycemia, the main symptom of diabetes, from glucose and Body Mass Index levels? By looking at female patient data from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, we may have the ability to construct a regression model and determine predictability and correlation.
